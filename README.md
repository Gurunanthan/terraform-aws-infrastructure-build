# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Build

This repository documents my journey of building AWS infrastructure using Terraform,
focusing on real-world architecture patterns and best practices.

The goal of this project is to understand Terraform deeply by designing and implementing
AWS infrastructure step by step, while being mindful of cost, structure, and scalability.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Learn Terraform by building real AWS infrastructure
- Understand how components depend on each other (VPC, ALB, ASG, EC2)
- Follow clean repository and module structure
- Practice infrastructure-as-code the way it is done in real projects
- Share progress and learning openly

---

## 🏗️ Planned Architecture (Incremental)

The architecture will be built gradually in layers:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- Public subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- Security Groups
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- EC2 instances with user data
- Terraform state management
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions (later stage)

> ⚠️ Infrastructure will be created for learning purposes and destroyed after testing
> to avoid unnecessary costs.
